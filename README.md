# Lottery DApp

A decentralized application for participating in a lottery on the Base Sepolia Testnet blockchain.

## Project Description

This web application allows users to interact with a lottery smart contract deployed on the Base Sepolia Testnet. Users can:

- Connect their wallet
- Mint USDTFAKE tokens to participate in the lottery
- Purchase lottery tickets
- Check the current lottery round status
- View their transaction history
- Claim winnings (connected address is one of the winners by default)
